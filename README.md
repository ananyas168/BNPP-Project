# BNPP-Project
This repo contains the code that I submited to outcoder.ai Genhack AI Competition on Generative Financial Modelling  of Financial Dataset. Our model was ranked under top 10 position out 1000 other Participants.

# Top 10 | Genhack AI Competition | Generative Financial Modelling | Outcoder.ai & BNP Paribas

1. Developed state of the art generative model that simulates stock market indexes for BNP Paribas Paris
2. Used a Generative adversarial network along with modified loss functions to learn and capture outliners. 
3. Performed hyperparameter tuning and data integration to achieve outstanding accuracy.
4. Further Evaluated the performance of the developed model using eclectic metrics like Kendal absolute error and Anderson Darling and achieved 0.017 and 1.10 Kendal and Anderson scores respectively.
